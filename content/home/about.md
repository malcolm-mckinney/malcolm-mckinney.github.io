Hello again — Malcolm here!

Let me briefly introduce myself. I am originally from North Carolina, a state which lies in the southern part of the United States. In 2015, I graduated from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) with a Bachelors of Arts in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/csmajor).
Regarding my professional experience, I have worked on a variety of software engineering projects at companies such as [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/), [Amazon Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/), and [LINE](https://line.me/en/).
Some of my work has even been featured in news sites like [TechCrunch Japan](https://bit.ly/3RUZi6S)! Anyone who would like to learn a bit more about my academic and work history, please feel free to have a look at the most recent version of my [résumé](Malcolm_McKinney_Resume.pdf).

Currently, I am based in Tokyo, Japan, where I have been a resident for the past seven years. Living and working abroad has always been a dream of mine and every day has certainly been an adventure!
I enjoy a mix of domestic (Japan) and international travel, art and history museums, learning Japanese, amateur photography, wine tasting, and — as you can see — most recently winter sports!
Please don't hesitate to drop me an [email](mailto:contact@malcolmmckinney.com) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malcolmmckinney/) if you'd like to get in touch with me!
