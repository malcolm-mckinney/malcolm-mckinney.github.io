Hello again â€” Malcolm here!
To start, I'm from North Carolina in the US and I graduated from Cornell University in 2015 with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science.
Regarding my professional experience, I have worked on a variety of software engineering projects at companies such as Apple, Wayfair, Amazon, and LINE.
I am currently based in Tokyo, Japan, where I have been living for the past seven years. Living and working abroad has definitely been an exciting adventure!
I enjoy a mix of domestic (Japan) and international travel, art and history museums, learning Japanese, restaurants, wineries, and, as you can see, most recently winter sports!
