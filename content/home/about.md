Hello again — Malcolm here!

Let me briefly introduce myself. I am originally from the state of North Carolina in the United States of America. In 2015, I graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science.
Regarding my professional experience, I have worked on a variety of software engineering projects at companies such as Apple, Wayfair, Amazon, and LINE.
For those who have a further interest in my work history, you can find such details in my most recent [résumé](Malcolm_McKinney_Resume.pdf).

Currently, I am based in Tokyo, Japan, where I have been living for the past seven years. Living and working abroad has always been a dream of mine and every day has certainly been an adventure!
I enjoy a mix of domestic (Japan) and international travel, art and history museums, learning Japanese, fine dining, wine tasting, and, as you can see, most recently winter sports!
Feel free to drop me an email or send me a message on LinkedIn if you would like to get in touch with me!
